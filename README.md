Bible App that can
- Search the bible
- Read different chapters
- Select darkmode

If you would like to use this same app via `git clone`, make sure you add an api key because one will not be provided when making a `clone`.

To add the api key, you must head over to `src/API.js` file. Then input your own API key like at the top like so:

```
const MY_API_KEY = "";
```

After that, the app should be working.

Otherwise, you can see the demo version here:
